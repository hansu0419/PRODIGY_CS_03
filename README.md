## Description
The Password Complexity Checker is a Python-based application designed to determine the complexity of a password. Users can input a password to perform compelxity checker. This tool uses zxcvbn, which is a password strength estimation library. This helps determine the time it takes for a hacker to get access. This tool also provides suggestions on how to improve the password's complexity to be less susceptible to perpetrators.

## Features
